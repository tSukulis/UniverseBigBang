# UniverseBigBang
Simulates the creation of the Universe using data structures, list
and trees in java.

   * Everything starts -initialises with Big Bang explosion.
   * The universe has galaxies, which have solar systems and orphan planets.
   * The simulation is done with :
    

 1. Lists , Sorted double linked Lists
 2. Hash table , Double linked Search Binary Tree
 
## INSTRUCTIONS
 * Import Project To eclipse or NetBeans
 * Give as argument the path of a test File
 * Run Main.java

### Cases
1. G_*<br />
   Creates Galaxies and prints all the elements of them.<br />
2. GS_*<br />
   Creates Galaxies, Solar Systems and prints all the elements of them.<br />
3. GSP_*<br />
   Creates one Galaxy, one Solar System and Planets. Finally prints all the elements of the Solar System<br />
4. GSP2_*<br />
   Creates Galaxies, Solar Systems and Planets. Finally prints all the elements of Every Galaxy.<br />
5. GSPF_*<br />
   Creates Galaxies, Solar Systems and Planets. Finally prints all the elements of Every Galaxy that are in a specific range.<br />
6. GSPD_*<br />
   Creates Galaxies, Solar Systems and Planets. Finally prints all the elements of Every Galaxy, deletes smoe of the Solar          Systems and prints again the whole System.<br />
7. GSPM_*<br />
   Creates Galaxies, Solar Systems and Planets. At the end prints all the elements of Every Galaxy, merges smoe of the Galaxies             and prints again the whole System.<br />
8. GSPDO_*<br />
   Creates one Galaxy, Solar Systems and Planets. At the end prints the Galaxy, deletes some of the Solar Systems, prints again the Galaxy, deletes Some Planets and orhan planets(those that survived a sun destruction) and prints again the whole Galaxy.<br />
9. reuse_*<br />
   Creates one Solar System, then deletes it and creates a new one with the same sid.<br />
10. random_*<br />
    Some Random cases. At the end prints the whole System.
